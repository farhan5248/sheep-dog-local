Feature: Code Generation for Only Issues

  \@sheep-dog-test
  These tests verify that code generation works correctly when names follow proper capitalization rules.

  Scenario: Cell name should start with a capital letter generation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file test step list assignment is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      | Row Cell List    |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is present | lowercase header |
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
          | Step Object Name                  | Step Definition Name | Step Parameters Name |
          | daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present           | lowercase header     |
      And The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup is set as follows
          | Proposal Id          | Proposal Description                    | Proposal Value   |
          | Capitalize cell name | Capitalize the first letter of the name | Lowercase header |
     When The xtext plugin apply quickfix action is performed as follows
          | Node Path                                                     |
          | TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1/Cell/1 |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file will be created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      | Row Cell List    |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is present | Lowercase header |

  Scenario: Test suite name should start with a capital letter generation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file is created as follows
          | Test Suite Name   |
          | lowercase process |
      And The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup is set as follows
          | Proposal Id                | Proposal Description                    | Proposal Value    |
          | Capitalize test suite name | Capitalize the first letter of the name | Lowercase process |
     When The xtext plugin apply quickfix action is performed as follows
          | Node Path   |
          | TestSuite/1 |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file will be created as follows
          | Test Suite Name   |
          | Lowercase process |

  Scenario: Test case name should start with a capital letter generation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file is created as follows
          | Test Suite Name | Test Case Name      |
          | Process2        | lowercase test case |
      And The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup is set as follows
          | Proposal Id                         | Proposal Description                    | Proposal Value      |
          | Capitalize test step container name | Capitalize the first letter of the name | Lowercase test case |
     When The xtext plugin apply quickfix action is performed as follows
          | Node Path                       |
          | TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1 |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file will be created as follows
          | Test Suite Name | Test Case Name      |
          | Process2        | Lowercase test case |
