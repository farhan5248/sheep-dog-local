    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file test step type is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name   |
          | <Test Step Full Name> |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file step object ref component fragment will be decomposed as follows
