Feature: Validation for Only Issues

  \@sheep-dog-test
  These validations check for syntax and naming issues that can be detected by parsing the file alone, without needing to check the workspace.

  Scenario: Header row Cell names should start with a capital letter validation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file test step list assignment is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      | Row Cell List |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is present | header        |
     When The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
          | Node Path                                                     |
          | TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1/Cell/1 |
     Then The xtext plugin validate annotation will be set as follows

  Scenario: Body row Cell names can be any case validation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file test step list assignment is created as follows

          Every test case must have at least one component specified.
          This should be the first part of the test step name.
          The component is optional.
          Component ending words are: application, service, plugin, batchjob, project.
          Examples are: "The something application," or "The something service,"Every test step must have the object specified.
          The object can have the complete path or not.
          Object ending words are: page, response, file, directory, dialog, popup, annotation, hover, tooltip, request, goal, job, action.

  Scenario: Test step must have a valid step definition name validation

          After specifying the step object name, a step definition name is specified.
          It has a part (optional) and state.
          Part is used to specify a part in a document, like the header or body.
          The part types are: language, type, assignment, fragment, scope.
          Examples are: "Customer details section" or "Order History table"
          State determines what gets converted to setters or assertions in the test automation.
          Next it's followed by the state description which is optional and can be any word.
          The state types are: is, isn't, will be, won't be.
          Examples are: "is present" or "will be created as follows"
