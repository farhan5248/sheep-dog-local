@sheep-dog-test
Feature: Grammar StepDefinitionRef Fragments

  \@sheep-dog-test
  A StepDefinitionRef identifies the part and state in a test step.

  Scenario Outline: Part Fragment

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file test step type is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                                       |
          | The daily batchjob Output file <Step Definition Ref Name> |
     When The xtext plugin validate action is performed
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file step definition ref part fragment will be decomposed as follows
          | Part   | Part Name   | Part Type   |
          | <Part> | <Part Name> | <Part Type> |

    Examples: Fragments

          | Step Definition Ref Name           | Part                      | Part Name      | Part Type  |
          | StepObjectRef type is empty        | StepObjectRef type        | StepObjectRef  | type       |
          | SheepDog language is empty         | SheepDog language         | SheepDog       | language   |
          | StepObjectName assignment is empty | StepObjectName assignment | StepObjectName | assignment |
          | Component fragment is empty        | Component fragment        | Component      | fragment   |
          | Only scope is empty                | Only scope                | Only           | scope      |
          | StepObjectRef node is empty        | StepObjectRef node        | StepObjectRef  | node       |

  Scenario Outline: State Fragment

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file test step type is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                                       |
          | The daily batchjob Output file <Step Definition Ref Name> |
     When The xtext plugin validate action is performed
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file step definition ref state fragment will be decomposed as follows
          | State   | State Modality   | State Type   |
          | <State> | <State Modality> | <State Type> |

    Examples: Fragments
