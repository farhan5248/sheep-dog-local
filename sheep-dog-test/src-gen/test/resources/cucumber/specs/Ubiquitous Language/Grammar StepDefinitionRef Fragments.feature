@sheep-dog-test
Feature: Grammar StepDefinitionRef Fragments

  \@sheep-dog-test
  A StepDefinitionRef identifies the part and state in a test step.

  @Grammar
  Scenario Outline: Part Fragment

    \@Grammar

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file test step type is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                                       |
          | The daily batchjob Output file <Step Definition Ref Name> |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file step definition ref part fragment will be decomposed as follows
          | Part   | Part Description   | Part Type   |
          | <Part> | <Part Description> | <Part Type> |

    Examples: Fragments

          | Step Definition Ref Name            | Part                      | Part Description | Part Type  |
          | StepObjectRef type is absent        | StepObjectRef type        | StepObjectRef    | type       |
          | SheepDog language is absent         | SheepDog language         | SheepDog         | language   |
          | StepObjectName assignment is absent | StepObjectName assignment | StepObjectName   | assignment |
          | Component fragment is absent        | Component fragment        | Component        | fragment   |
          | Only scope is absent                | Only scope                | Only             | scope      |
          | StepObjectRef node is absent        | StepObjectRef node        | StepObjectRef    | node       |

  @Grammar
  Scenario Outline: State Fragment

    \@Grammar

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file test step type is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                                       |
          | The daily batchjob Output file <Step Definition Ref Name> |
     Then The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/ProcessGrammar.asciidoc file step definition ref state fragment will be decomposed as follows
          | State   | State Description   | State Type   |
          | <State> | <State Description> | <State Type> |

    Examples: Fragments

          | Step Definition Ref Name     | State                 | State Type | State Description  |
