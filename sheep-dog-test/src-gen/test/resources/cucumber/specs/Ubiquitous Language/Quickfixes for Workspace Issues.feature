Feature: Quickfixes for Workspace Issues

  \@sheep-dog-test
  Some problems are fixed by code generation.
  They're typically things like keywords or objects that are not defined in the step objects layer.
  I could just ignore all those warnings and then use the Build Project menu item and it'll create everything at once.
  There's 4 types of warnings, the scenarios below cover them.

  Scenario: This object doesn't exist quickfix

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file test step list assignment is created as follows
