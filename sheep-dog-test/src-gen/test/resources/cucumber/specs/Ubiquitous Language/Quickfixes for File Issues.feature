Feature: Quickfixes for File Issues

  \@sheep-dog-test
  Some problems prevent code generation.
  For example not knowing which component an object belongs to gets in the way of knowing where to create the file.

  Scenario: The first step needs to have a component specified quickfix

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file TestSuite/1/TestCase/1/TestStep node is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is present |
          | The Input file is downloaded             |
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepObject node is created as follows
          | Step Object Name                  |
          | daily batchjob/Input file.feature |
      And The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file StepObject/1/StepDefinition node is created as follows
          | Step Definition Name | Step Definition Description |
          | is present           | Creates empty file          |
      And The xtext plugin validate annotation is empty
     When The xtext plugin list quickfixes action is performed as follows
          | Node Path              |
          | TestSuite/1/TestCase/1 |
     Then The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup will be empty

  Scenario: No component in the first step triggers an error quickfix

    The first step needs to have a component specified.
    The other steps default to that one.

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file TestSuite/1/TestCase/1/TestStep node is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                         |
          | The Input file is present                   |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is downloaded |
      And The xtext plugin validate annotation is set as follows
          """
          The first step must have a component
          """
     When The xtext plugin list quickfixes action is performed as follows
          | Node Path              |
          | TestSuite/1/TestCase/1 |
     Then The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup will be empty
