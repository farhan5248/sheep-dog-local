  TODO Add tests for each quickfix one
  TODO Add test step ensuring step object isn't changed until after the quickfix is applied
  The Xtext framework lets you map the DSL to Java so that you can generate the Java code with minimal coding.
  I think that's useful for a tester if every component is written in Java or the same language.
  If it's not, and there's PL/SQL, COBOL, webMethods, Layer 7 and other such languages, you might not need Java code but insert statements for example.
  In that case, generating Java code isn't that useful so I generate the lower layer describing each object.
  One way to see these two layers is that the test cases in the first layer are paths in a graph model and the steps in the second are the vertices.
  There's 3 things to generate
  1. An object such as an input file or report, a web-page or web-service response etc.
  2. A keyword or statement aka step definition about that object such as whether is exists, or has certain attributes or fields.
  3. A combination of parameters for that statement. This could be different combinations of search fields used in a search page.

  Scenario: This object doesn't exist generation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file test step list assignment is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      |
          | The daily batchjob Input file is present |
      And The xtext plugin list quickfixes popup is set as follows
          | Proposal Id                                             | Proposal Description |
          | Generate Input file - daily batchjob/Input file.feature | empty                |
     When The xtext plugin apply quickfix action is performed as follows
