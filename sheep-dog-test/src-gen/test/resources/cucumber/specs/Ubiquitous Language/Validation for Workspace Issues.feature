Feature: Validation for Workspace Issues

  \@sheep-dog-test
  Some problems are fixed by code generation.
  They're typically things like keywords or objects that are not defined in the step objects layer.
  I could just ignore all those warnings and then use the Build Project menu item and it'll create everything at once.
  There's 4 types of warnings, the scenarios below cover them.

  Scenario: This object doesn't exist validation

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file TestSuite/1/TestCase/1/TestStep node is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                      |

     Then The xtext plugin validate annotation will be set as follows
          """
          The step object file doesn't exist for the component
          """

  Scenario: This object step definition doesn't exist validation

  Scenario: This object step definition text parameter exists validation

    Step definitions for Text Content only have one parameter called "Content"

    Given The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file TestSuite/1/TestCase/1/TestStep node is created as follows
          | Test Step Full Name                             |

     Then The xtext plugin validate annotation will be empty

  Scenario: This object step definition text parameter doesn't exist validation

    If there isn't a step definition in the step object file with a Content header, then a warning is displayed.
